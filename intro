Deep Learning Repository

Welcome to my Deep Learning journey repository! 🚀

This repo is a collection of my notes, experiments, and practice projects as I begin exploring the world of Deep Learning. My goal is to gradually build a strong foundation, starting from the basics and moving toward more advanced topics and applications.

📌 Goals

Learn the fundamentals of neural networks

Practice with simple models (perceptrons, feedforward networks)

Explore key architectures (CNNs, RNNs, Transformers)

Work on small projects and datasets to gain hands-on experience

Document progress, challenges, and learnings

📂 Repository Structure

Notebooks/ → Jupyter notebooks with code experiments

Notes/ → Concepts, theory, and math summaries

Projects/ → Small projects applying what I’ve learned

Resources/ → Helpful links, papers, and tutorials

🛠 Tools & Frameworks

I will be primarily learning and practicing with:

Python 🐍

NumPy & Pandas (for data handling)

Matplotlib & Seaborn (for visualization)

PyTorch / TensorFlow (for building deep learning models)

🌱 Current Status

I am a beginner in deep learning, so expect lots of learning steps, trial and error, and continuous improvement. This repository will serve as both a study log and a portfolio of my growth in the field.
